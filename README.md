# YouTube-Downloader
This is a Python script that allows users to download videos from either a predefined playlist or a
    user-created playlist with the option to choose the resolution of the videos.
    
    :param title: The title of the video being downloaded
    :return: Nothing is being returned. The code is prompting the user to choose between creating their
    own playlist or using a predefined playlist, and then downloading videos from the chosen playlist
    based on the user's selected resolution. The code also replaces any invalid characters in the video
    title with underscores to ensure the file can be saved properly. Finally, the code waits for the
    user to press enter before exiting.
